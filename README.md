# BlackBoxChallenge
Training a neural net to work with the blackbox challenge.

The blackbox challenge is a reinforcement learning paradigm that gives you actions [0,1,2,3] and a reward that changes. Our job is to find the optimal strategy of exploration and exploitation of our possible actions as we learn from our past actions.
